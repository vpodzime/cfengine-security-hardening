The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. Users
should not be able to execute SUID or SGID binaries from temporary storage
partitions.

/tmp should be a separate mount point with a =nosuid= mount option that can be
used to prevent execution of SUID programs in /tmp.


* Variables

- =northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action=:
  controls whether only warnings should be emitted (="warn"=) or actual changes to fix issues should
  be made (="fix"=)


* Examples

Example of a /cf-agent/ run on a host that doesn't have /tmp as a separate
mount point:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
R: WARNING: /tmp should be a separate mount point so that it can be mounted with the 'nosuid' option
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example of /cf-agent/ run on a host that has /tmp mounted without the =nosuid=
option *without* =northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action= set to ="fix"=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
R: WARNING: /tmp should be mounted with 'nosuid' option
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example of /cf-agent/ run on a host that has /tmp mounted without the =nosuid=
option using a line in /etc/fstab *with*
=northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action= set to ="fix"=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
    info: Completed execution of '/bin/mount -o remount,rw,seclabel,relatime,nosuid /tmp/'
R: NOTICE: /tmp was successfully remounted with the 'nosuid' option
    info: Appended field sub-value 'nosuid' in '/etc/fstab'
    info: fields_edit promise '(?!#)\S+\s+/tmp\s.+' repaired
    info: Edited file '/etc/fstab'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example of /cf-agent/ run on a host that has /tmp mounted without the =nosuid=
option using a system .mount unit *with*
=northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action= set to ="fix"=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
    info: Executing 'no timeout' ... '/bin/mount -o remount,rw,seclabel,nosuid /tmp/'
    info: Completed execution of '/bin/mount -o remount,rw,seclabel,nosuid /tmp/'

    info: Moved '/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount.cfnew' to '/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount'
    info: Updated file '/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount' from 'localhost:/usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount'
    info: Deleted the promised line 1 'Options=mode=1777,strictatime' from /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
    info: delete_lines promise 'Options=.*' repaired
    info: Inserted the promised line 'Options=mode=1777,strictatime,nosuid' into '/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount' after locator
    info: insert_lines promise 'Options=mode=1777,strictatime,nosuid' repaired
    info: Edited file '/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount'
    info: Executing 'no timeout' ... '/usr/bin/systemctl daemon-reload'
    info: Completed execution of '/usr/bin/systemctl daemon-reload'
#+END_EXAMPLE

In case the remount fails for some reason, the following report is printed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
R: WARNING: Failed to remount /tmp with the 'nosuid' option. Make sure the option is added to the default mount options for /tmp and reboot the machine
#+END_EXAMPLE
