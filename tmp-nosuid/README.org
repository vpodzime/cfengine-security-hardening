The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. Users
should not be able to execute SUID or SGID binaries from temporary storage
partitions.

/tmp should be a separate mount point with a =nosuid= mount option that can be
used to prevent execution of SUID programs in /tmp.


* Variables

- =northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action=:
  controls whether only warnings should be emitted (="warn"=) or actual changes to fix issues should
  be made (="fix"=)


* Examples

Example of a /cf-agent/ run on a host that doesn't have /tmp as a separate
mount point:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
R: WARNING: /tmp should be a separate mount point so that it can be mounted with the 'nosuid' option
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example of /cf-agent/ run on a host that has /tmp mounted without the =nosuid=
option *without* =northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action= set to ="fix"=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
R: WARNING: /tmp should be mounted with 'nosuid' option
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example of /cf-agent/ run on a host that has /tmp mounted without the =nosuid=
option *with* =northerntech_security_hardening:tmp_nosuid.action= set to ="fix"=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
    info: Executing 'no timeout' ... '/bin/mount -o remount,rw,seclabel,nosuid /tmp/'
    info: Completed execution of '/bin/mount -o remount,rw,seclabel,nosuid /tmp/'
R: NOTICE: /tmp was successfully remounted with the 'nosuid' option, make sure the option is added to the default mount options for /tmp
#+END_EXAMPLE

In case the remount fails for some reason, the following report is printed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
R: WARNING: Failed to remount /tmp with the 'nosuid' option. Make sure the option is added to the default mount options for /tmp and reboot the machine
#+END_EXAMPLE


* TODO
- fix the particular line in /etc/fstab (if any) and add the =nosuid= option there
- fix the particular line in the systemd mount unit for /tmp (if any) and add
  the =nosuid= option there
