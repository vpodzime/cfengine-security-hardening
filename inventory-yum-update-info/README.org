Repositories with updates provide information about types of the updates. Security updates are
particularly important and adding a number of security updates for each host to inventory allows
periodic reports, alerts and compliance reports based on those numbers to be created.

In Mission Portal, the CFEngine Enterprise UI, you can get reports of available security updates on
hosts:

(To see this, go to /Reports/ -> /Inventory/ -> Click the 3 dots at the top of a column -> /Insert Column/
-> /Security updates/ and similar for the other attributes.)


* Inventory

The following attributes provide the numbers of available update in each category:

- /Security updates/ ::
- /Critical Security updates/ ::
- /Important Security updates/ ::
- /Moderate Security updates/ ::
- /Low Security updates/ ::


* Variables

- =northerntech_security_hardening:inventory_yum_update_info.refresh_updateinfo_interval= ::
  controls how often the update info data is refreshed, /default: 60/ (minutes)


* Limitations

*As the name of this module suggests, it only supports systems where /yum updateinfo/ provides the
necessary data.*
