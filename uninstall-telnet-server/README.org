Telnet is a protocol for providing an *insecure* remote virtual terminal access
to hosts over network. It is generally considered obsolete and dangerous and its
use has been a root cause of security issues. It should not be used except for
very specific use cases.

This module makes sure that the Telnet *server* packages are not installed on
hosts and thus also not running.

* Examples

Example of a /cf-agent/ run on a host that has the =telnet-server= package installed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[root@hub]# cf-agent -KI
    info: Successfully removed package 'telnet-server'
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Adding exceptions

If Telnet server packages are really needed on some specific hosts, they can be
marked as such by defining the =hardening_telnet_server_allowed= class in either
augments or CMDB.
